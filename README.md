# CIS106-Brian-Estrada
Hey, my name is Brian, I'm taking CIS this semester because I think that this a is a good starting point to learn computer science. I want to strengthen my knowledge of computers, software and technology overall more.  When I was little, I wanted to create video games and that kind of stuck to me the whole way, now I'm going to focused more on other parts of programing like app or web developing but I hope to make a game or two in the future. From the context so far, this class is going to make me manage my time better by planning and reading code efficiently. Since I haven't done any projects in like a year or two I'm looking forward to working on this class.
